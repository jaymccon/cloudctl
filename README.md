# cloudctl

`cloudctl` is an experiemental  cli for the cloud based on [AWS Cloud Conrol API](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/announcing-aws-cloud-control-api/). It aims to provide a consisten and user-centric cli experience.

*Project state:* pre-alpha 

## Guiding principles

* Generate all the things. However, it should be possible to add a new service that cloud api supports 
without needing to recompile the binary. 
* maximise consistency wherever possible. consistent tools are intuitive tools.
* devX has a priority multiplier over complexity. A feature should still be considered even if it adds 4 units of complexity for every 1 unit of devX.
* open and inclusive ecosystems thrive. No descisions or work should take place behind closed doors. Diverse opinions 
are sought out and valued.

## Contributing

Start off by trying out the project in it's current state, then get involved in the discussion by looking through the [open proposals](https://github.com/jaymccon/cloudctl/labels/proposal) or [create a new proposal](https://github.com/jaymccon/cloudctl/issues/new). Proposals are a great mechanism for discussing larger feature adds or changes to the project but are not required for smaller items like bug fixes and code quality improvements.

# cloudctl


## Tenets (hopefully you know better ones, these ones have their heart in the right place, 
but are a bit "jazz handy":tm: @andrew-glenn)

* Generate all the things. It should be possible to add a new service that cloud api supports 
without any manual intervention (user having to download an updated binary is ok). 
this does not mean that we can't add overlays that require manual steps, 
when those manual steps are in the aid of devX.
* maximise consistency wherever possible. consistent tools are intuitive tools
* devX should have a multiplier over complexity. If a feature adds 1 unit of devX and 4 
units of complexity, do it anyways
* open and inclusive ecosystems thrive. No descisions or work should take place behind closed doors. Diverse opinions 
are valued
